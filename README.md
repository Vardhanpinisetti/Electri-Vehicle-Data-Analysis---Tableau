Electric Vehicle Data Analysis Tableau Project
This project, titled "Electric Vehicle Data Analysis Tableau", is focused on providing a comprehensive analysis of electric vehicle (EV) adoption and trends using data visualization techniques. The analysis covers both Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), aiming to deliver actionable insights into the current EV landscape.

Key Objectives and KPIs:

                  - Total Vehicles: Assess the overall size and growth of the electric vehicle market by analyzing the total number of EVs, including both BEVs and PHEVs.

                  - Average Electric Range: Calculate the average electric range of vehicles in the dataset to evaluate advancements in EV technology and efficiency.

                  - Total BEV Vehicles & % of Total: Identify the total number of BEVs and determine their percentage share within the broader EV market, highlighting the prevalence of fully electric models.

                  - Total PHEV Vehicles & % of Total: Identify the total number of PHEVs and calculate their market share, offering a comparison with BEVs and insights into consumer preferences for hybrid technology.

Visualizations and Chart Requirements:

                   - Total Vehicles by Model Year (From 2011 Onwards): A line or area chart visualizing the growth and adoption trends of EVs over time, starting from 2011.

                   - Total Vehicles by State: A map chart depicting the geographic distribution of EVs, pinpointing states with higher adoption rates and regional trends.

                   - Top 10 Total Vehicles by Make: A bar chart highlighting the top 10 manufacturers by total EV sales, showcasing brand dominance in the market.

                   - Total Vehicles by CAFV Eligibility: A pie or donut chart illustrating the proportion of EVs eligible for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) incentives, providing insight into the impact of government incentives on EV adoption.

                   - Total Vehicles by Model: A grid view listing the top 10 EV models by total vehicles, revealing consumer preferences and popular models.

Software Requirements:

     - MS Office/Excel: Version 2024

     - Tableau: Version 2025.2.0

Final Conclusion: 
This project shows that electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming much more popular, especially in the last few years. Most EVs are fully electric (BEVs), while a smaller part are plug-in hybrids (PHEVs). Tesla is the leading brand, with its Model Y and Model 3 being the most popular cars. Some states have many more EVs than others, showing that location and local policies matter. Also, about 43% of vehicles are eligible for special government incentives, which help encourage people to buy EVs. Overall, the data shows strong growth in the EV market, with technology and government support playing big roles.
